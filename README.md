# Image Classification and Object Detection
## Introduction
Currently, plastic waste in the ocean is becoming more and more. In 2015, the amount of plastic waste was only 1/5 of the amount of marine life, but now the number has reached 1/3, and it is predicted that by 2050, the ocean will have more plastic.

This source code is to build algorithms to automatically detect and classify fish and plastic waste.

## Dataset
Everyone can download datasets from many different sources:
- Dataset Search (Google).
- Kaggle.
- Taco.
- .v.v.

## Models
- Set up and build CNN models.
- Select suitable pre-trained models and build corresponding models.
- Use YOLOv4 model.

## Evaluation
- CNN
- Resnet50v2
- VGG16
- Densnet201
