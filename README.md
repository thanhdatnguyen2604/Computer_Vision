# Image Classification and Object Detection
## Introduction
Currently, plastic waste in the ocean is becoming more and more. In 2015, the amount of plastic waste was only 1/5 of the amount of marine life, but now the number has reached 1/3, and it is predicted that by 2050, the ocean will have more plastic.

This source code is to build algorithms to automatically detect and classify fish and plastic waste.

## Dataset
Everyone can download datasets from many different sources:
- Dataset Search (Google)
